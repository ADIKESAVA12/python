# print has 5 parameters

# object --->the value to be printed is object
# sep---> seperater 
# eg
# a = 8
# b = 9
# c = 89
# print(a,b,c  sep='$')

# end --->which is used add the string at the end vaule,
#  # it will not keep the command to stay in line
# Eg:
# print(str(a),b, end='%%')
# print(str(c))

Variables:
# variable is name which is used to identify the value of variable
# which is stored in specific memory location

Rules to define variables:
# 1.)variables have to start with only alphabets, underscore.
# 2.)The char following the first char can be alphabets numbers, underscore
# 3.)No spaces are allowed
# 4.)No special special characterstics like !@3$%^&8()+
# 5.)case sensitive
# 6.)keywords are not allowed as varaiables.
 

# ways to define varaiables

# a = 8
# b = 9
# print(a,b)
  
# a = 7,b = 9 # error
# print(a,b)
# print(a)
# print(b)


# a=7
# b=7

# a = b = 7
# print(a, b)

# a=8, 7, 9.89, "hello"
# print

print("hello world")
"""
print("hello world")
print("hello world")
print("hello world")
print("hello world")

1)commenting is used for making documentation in a python file>
2)when the line is connected,that line will not be considered as a part of the code.
3)when the program is executed,commented line will not be in the part of execution.



-----> NOTE:
single line commanding can be done by using # at the begging og the line

    Eg:
        #print("hello world")


Mutliple line commenting can be done ''' code '''. The lines between the quotes will be commented.

print("hello world")
print("hello world")
print("hello world")
print("hello world")
"""
#print("hello world)
